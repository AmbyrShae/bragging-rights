# BraggingRights

Everyone has a story! Bragging Rights is an opportunity to learn more about your coworkers as they share the highs and lows of their social/professional journey lines. These sessions were initially held to empower women to speak up about their achievements and the obstacles they faced in pursuit of their goals. It is currently being used for the Bragging Rights sessions held by the Women's Network at my current job.
